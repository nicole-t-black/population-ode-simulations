# Population ODE Simulations

This repository contains Python scripts and calculations for simulating population dynamics and solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

## Features

- Malthusian population growth with and without carrying capacity
- Steady state analysis and stability conditions for ODE systems
- Eulerâ€™s method simulations for generic ODE systems
- Predator-prey models (foxes & rabbits, lynxes & hares)
- Hebbian learning ODE model
